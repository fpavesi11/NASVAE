This repository implements different VAE for neural architecture search. 
Neural architectures are based on the grammar from https://github.com/fpavesi11/CFG_NAS.


Approaches implemented are
    - Vanilla VAE: Both with diagonal covariance and full covariance
    - Flow VAE: With different types of flow (only planar flow has been tested)
    - IAF VAE: With two different inverse autoregressive flows (suggested: standard version)
